# Weather App
> weather-backend

A web application designed to provide relevant information on weather in New York City, NY, USA

It's a proxy server for OpenWeatherAPI.

OpenWeatherAPI has CORS policy that is why the [weather-frontend](https://github.com/tatianakomar/weather-frontend) can not call OpenWeather API directly.


## Run locally

`npm install` - to install dependencies

`npm run start` â€” to launch the server
